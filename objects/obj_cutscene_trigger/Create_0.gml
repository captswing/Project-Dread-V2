// Three variables that tie into the event flags that will be crucial for disabling/enabling certain cutscene
// triggers, cutscene objects, and so on. The first variable points to a list that stores all of the requied 
// flags that must be set in order for this event to be active in the room. This list can be empty if no flags
// need to be set before this trigger's flag is set. Meanwhile, the index variable stores the value into the
// event flag list that its flag corresponds to. Finally, the required state variable stores what state the
// event flag should be for the trigger to be destroyed.
